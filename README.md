# Html5-game-webpack

Use a clean structure with classes in my simple html5 & webpack prototype game with Phaser 3.

npm install:	  Install project dependencies <br/>
npm start:    	Build project and open web server running project <br/>
npm run build: 	Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..)

You can find all the game folders under js file.
