# Html5-game-webpack

I have tried to use a good and clean structure in my simple introduction game.

npm install	Install project dependencies
npm start	Build project and open web server running project
npm run build	Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..)

You can find all the game folders under js file.
